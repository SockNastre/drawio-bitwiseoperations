Before reading this document, make sure you have read the document
"Textual Bitwise-Operations Setup" as that helps setup a basis for this.

So, sure, we setup our tBitOps and now we want to read them properly right?
This is not so simple as it sounds, we will discuss some algorithm approaches
we can use to grab variables, operations, operations in association with
variables.

Before getting into that, a variable in our standard is a value output. So if
we have the operation "A OR B", A and B are the variables here; they output
the numbers associated with them. Even though A and B on their own have no
operation being done, that itself is an operation... no operation!

Sticking with "A OR B", there is one more variable you may have missed. This
variable would be the entirety of "A OR B"! This operation results in the
output of a value, so it is a variable.

Now that you know what a variable is to our tool, an operation is simply the
bitwise operation being done to a variable or two variables.
